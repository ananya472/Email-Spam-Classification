# Email-Spam-Classification
Email Spam Classification using Machine Learning


 Objective:  Develop a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam.
 Conducted thorough data preprocessing, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization using NLTK
 and scikit-learn.
 Explored and visualised email dataset characteristics using pandas and matplotlib to gain insights into data
 distribution and features.
 Implemented and fine-tuned machine learning algorithms (such as Naive Bayes and SVM) to achieve a
 classification accuracy of 95% on the test dataset.
 Developed a Flask-based web application with an intuitive user interface for users to classify emails
 interactively
